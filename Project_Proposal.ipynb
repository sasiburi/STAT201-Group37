    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how crime incidences vary by geographic region is an ongoing area of study by researchers. This report looks at the incidence of violent crime activity within different communities of Vancouver, a populous city in British Columbia, Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "An examination of violent crimes in Vancouver in 1996, found that the highest rates of violent crimes were concentrated in the Downtown Eastside and surrounding neighbourhoods, with violent crime rates decreasing as one moved further away from this epicenter (Andreson, 2017). Further, between 2001 and 2008 in Vancouver, geographic hotspots for violent trauma incidents were identified to be the Downtown and Downtown Eastside neighbourhoods (Walker et. al., 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we are seeking to answer the question: between Point Grey, Kitsilano, and the Central Business District, how does geographic location affect violent crime incidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will use the Vancouver Crime Dataset released by Vancouver Police Department (VPD) as the sample. The dataset describes the type of crime, along with the location and time that the crime occurred, across ten variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be calculating two quantities of interest to answer this question: the median yearly proportion of violent crime in each neighbourhood between the years of 2003 - 2021, and the mean yearly count of violent crime in each neighbourhood between the years of 2003 - 2021."

    "## Methods\n",

    "The current analysis of the data set demonstrates several strengths. To begin, the calculation of the parameters were done using a reproducible data science workflow, promoting the trustworthiness of the results of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset does not represent the entire population of crimes in Vancouver, as not all crimes committed are reported to police authorities. However, the dataset was collected in an unbiased manner, promoting further trust in our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset represents a sample of all crimes committed in Vancouver, we cannot confidently say that our results truly reflect the population. There may be some error in our analysis since we only examined a subset of the population, and therefore, we need to quantify the error that was introduced into the calculated parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the error that may be present within our analysis, we will calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 90% confidence interval of each parameter\n",
    "- Hypothesis test that the further a community is from the Central Business District, the lower their mean yearly amount of violent crime incidents. West Point Grey is further than Kitsilano from the Central Business District, and from our initial results, has a lower yearly mean of violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the preliminary data analysis, we expect to find that the further a neighbourhood is from the Central Business District, the lower the amount of violent crime it has. In identifying neighbourhoods with the greatest proportion of crimes, we can research what are common social determinants in Vancouver neighbourhoods that cause higher incidences of violent crime. The impacts of these findings can aid policy makers and community leaders in crafting interventions to reduce crime in these neighbourhoods, and create safer communities. \n"
