    "# STAT 201 Project Proposal: Violent Crime Incidents in three Vancouver Neighbourhoods\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how crime incidences vary by geographic region is an ongoing area of study by researchers. This report looks at the incidence of violent crime activity within different communities of Vancouver, a populous city in British Columbia, Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "An examination of violent crimes in Vancouver in 1996, found that the highest rates of violent crimes were concentrated in the Downtown Eastside and surrounding neighbourhoods, with violent crime rates decreasing as one moved further away from this epicenter (Andreson, 2017). Further, between 2001 and 2008 in Vancouver, geographic hotspots for violent trauma incidents were identified to be the Downtown and Downtown Eastside neighbourhoods (Walker et. al., 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we are seeking to answer the question: between Point Grey, Kitsilano, and the Central Business District, how does geographic location affect violent crime incidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will use the Vancouver Crime Dataset released by Vancouver Police Department (VPD) as the sample. The dataset describes the type of crime, along with the location and time that the crime occurred, across ten variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be calculating two quantities of interest to answer this question: the median yearly proportion of violent crime in each neighbourhood between the years of 2003 - 2021, and the mean yearly count of violent crime in each neighbourhood between the years of 2003 - 2021."
